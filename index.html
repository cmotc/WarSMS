<h2>Carrier Determination by Email-to-SMS Gateway Probing</h2>

<p><em>Please don't use this program to do anything illegal, or creepy, or</em>
<em>even unduly inconvenience an incumbent telecom. That would be wrong.</em>
<em>Don't stalk anyone, don't use it to send spam or mass texts or spend</em>
<em>people's minutes or whatever. Be considerate dammit, and don't get me</em>
<em>in trouble. This tool is intended only for educational and legitimate</em>
<em>security assessments/research only. Depending on what I can get an email</em>
<em>to SMS gatway to do in the future this could get creepy kinda fast.</em></p>

<p><em>I am most concerned about the implications of the Email-to-SMS gateway terms</em>
<em>of use violations. Anyone with an idea whether this program constitutes misuse</em>
<em>should contact me so I can make a release.</em></p>

<p>Basically, what this does is takes a phone number and a country and tests that
phone number against all the Email-to-SMS gateways in that country to determine
which carrier administers that phone number. There will be a response that the
address was not found if the carrier does not hold the phone number, and there
will be either no response or a response from the owner of the number. Either
way, the messages will be different enough to determine automatically. A sort of
skeleton "warsms-fake-daemon" is provided to run fetchmail periodically and
output the response to a folder where it will be stored, finally cacheing the
correct gateway which will reveal the carrier and provide a channel for sending
SMS and MMS messages to the device.</p>

<p>To learn to use it, for now, read the code. It's pretty self explanatory. Most
of the options are the same as for /usr/bin/mail. There are ways to use rc
config files too.</p>

<p><strong>THIS IS ENTIRELY UNTESTED</strong> Given that all the laws are so fuzzy surrounding
how these things can be used and the fact that I don't want to be a spammer, or
you know, jail. Jail sounds really shitty. And a stupid way to respond to 
legitimate experimentation, I might add. Until it's tested, this is just an
mildly elaborate hypothesis. I've never run this script, not once, because I'm
not a lawyer and I'm not sure who I'd annoy if I did. I'm poor and I don't want
to spend time away from my cat so I'm playing it safe.</p>

<p><strong>THIS VERSION IS DELIBERATELY DISABLED</strong> A cursory reading of the code will
allow you to enable it. It will remain so until I'm clear on the legal issues.</p>

<h2>Ports/Clonses:</h2>

<p>First of all, it's a shell script, because it makes sense to write things like
this as shell scripts on the platforms I use. That means unix for now, 
obviously, but all these tools have equivalents on any usable platform in the 
world today, so make a version that uses it, fork if necessary, and make it so
people can pull off this cheap trick on any platform they want(assuming it's
legal in your jurisdiction).</p>

<h2>Special SMS Support?:</h2>

<p>It would be very useful to be able to send Type-0 SMS Messages thereby eliciting
an automatic response which could be used in lieu of process-of-elimination.
I'm not remotely sure it's possible to trick a phone into thinking an sms from
a gateway is a Ping SMS but if it is it would be useful. Definitely taking it
into misuse territory here.</p>
