Ports/Clonses:
--------------
First of all, it's a shell script, because it makes sense to write things like
this as shell scripts on the platforms I use. That means unix for now, 
obviously, but all these tools have equivalents on any usable platform in the 
world today, so make a version that uses it, fork if necessary, and make it so
people can pull off this cheap trick on any platform they want(assuming it's
legal in your jurisdiction).

Special SMS Support?:
---------------------
It would be very useful to be able to send Type-0 SMS Messages thereby eliciting
an automatic response which could be used in lieu of process-of-elimination.
I'm not remotely sure it's possible to trick a phone into thinking an sms from
a gateway is a Ping SMS but if it is it would be useful.
